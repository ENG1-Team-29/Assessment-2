## Description

You are a privateer with allegiance to one College at the University of York. You sail the great Lake of
York on quests and adventures, and may choose to attack ships of other Colleges, try to sack
Colleges, etc. Gameplay ends when the player is defeated in some way (e.g., in combat with
another privateer, or destroyed by a rival College), or when the player has achieved the gameâ€™s
objective.

## Running The Game

1. Ensure you have Java 11 installed
2. Download either 1) the jar file or 2) one of the OS-specific versions
    1. Run the jar file by double clicking or running it in the terminal with: ``java -jar <name-of-file>.jar``
    2. Extract the contents of the archive and run the executable file within

Note: The OS specific versions come pre-bundled with Java so you do not need to have Java installed.
